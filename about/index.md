I am an engineer with drive for finding new challenges, or taking a different approach on existing challenges, to better understand the world around us.

I have been working on gaining a better understanding through data for my entire career, starting out as research & development engineer on nuclear reactors, continuing through Wall Street as an equities analyst, and into the corporate world where I have modeled various situations from insurance policy pricing to private aircraft usage.

This journey has been made possible, in part, by my enjoyment of learning new tools. From my early days coding in undergrad, to running radiation shielding calculations on SGI workstations in the 90's, and shredding through excel/VBA capabilities in the corporate world, I have never stopped searching for better tools.

My drive for continuous development has led me to my current position in a data science immersive program, where I can fine tune my SQL abilities and accelerate my understanding of Python, machine learning, and other skills necessary to handle larger and larger data sets.
